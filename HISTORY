Sanitize History
================================================================================

Version ? (?)
  * Removed htmlentities gem dependency.
  * Existing well-formed character entity references in the input string are now
    preserved rather than being decoded and re-encoded.
  * The ' character is now encoded as &#39; instead of &apos; to prevent
    problems in IE6.

Version 1.0.5 (2009-02-05)
  * Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.0.3 that prevented non-whitelisted
    protocols from being cleaned when relative URLs were allowed. [Reported by
    Dev Purkayastha]
  * Fixed "undefined method `parent='" exceptions caused by parser changes in
    edge Hpricot.

Version 1.0.4 (2009-01-16)
  * Fixed a bug that made it possible to sneak a non-whitelisted element through
    by repeating it several times in a row. All versions of Sanitize prior to
    1.0.4 are vulnerable. [Reported by Cristobal]

Version 1.0.3 (2009-01-15)
  * Fixed a bug whereby incomplete Unicode or hex entities could be used to
    prevent non-whitelisted protocols from being cleaned. Since IE6 and Opera
    still decode the incomplete entities, users of those browsers may be
    vulnerable to malicious script injection on websites using versions of
    Sanitize prior to 1.0.3.

Version 1.0.2 (2009-01-04)
  * Fixed a bug that caused an exception to be thrown when parsing a valueless
    attribute that's expected to contain a URL.

Version 1.0.1 (2009-01-01)
  * You can now specify :relative in a protocol config array to allow attributes
    containing relative URLs with no protocol. The Basic and Relaxed configs
    have been updated to allow relative URLs.
  * Added a workaround for an Hpricot bug that causes HTML entities for
    non-ASCII characters to be replaced by question marks, and all other
    entities to be destructively decoded.

Version 1.0.0 (2008-12-25)
  * First release.
